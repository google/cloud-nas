# Expected result when using TPU-v2 8 cores:
#   mIOU: 0.66
#   FLOPS: 23
#   Duration of each trial: 25 hrs
train:
  # Train file pattern is provided by the binary flag.

  # Reduce the batch-size if you run into out-of-memory error.
  # Out-of-memory error may also be resolved by reducing
  # the image-size but at the expense of quality.
  # NOTE: 256 is for 4x4 TPU Pod. May need to adjust batch size and learning rate for 2x2 or GPU devices.

  # 'eval_batch_size' needs to be divisible by 8 when using TPU.
